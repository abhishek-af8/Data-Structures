# Data Structures (C Language)

This repository contains my implementations of **Data Structures in C**, written while learning from first principles.

I am currently at **Step 1** of my learning journey:
- understanding how data structures work internally
- focusing on pointers, memory allocation, and structural correctness
- writing code manually to build strong fundamentals (not optimized or generic APIs yet)

The code here reflects **learning in progress**, not production-ready libraries.

---

## Purpose of this Repository is:

- To document my learning journey over time
- To build a **strong foundation** in Data Structures using C
- To understand **how memory and pointers actually work**
- To serve as a reference for my **future self** to see growth and improvement

As I progress, I will:
- add more data structures
- write better abstractions and helper functions
- improve documentation and structure

---

## Current Status

- Language: **C**
- Focus: **Fundamentals and internal logic**
- Level: **Beginner → Intermediate transition**
- Learning style: **Manual implementation → Gradual abstraction**

Each data structure (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.) will have its **own folder and README** explaining:
- What I understood at that time
- Assumptions made
- Limitations of the implementation

Some implimentations will have comments at the end too, explaining :
- What was my thought process while coming out with that implimentation
- What were the mistakes committed
- How did I fix them

---

## Note

This repository is intentionally **not polished**.
It is meant to show **how my thinking evolves**, not just final answers.

I will keep updating this repository as I learn more.
